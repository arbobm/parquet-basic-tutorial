### History

<!-- wikipedia -->
The open-source project to build Apache Parquet began as a joint effort between Twitter[3] and Cloudera.[4] Parquet was designed as an improvement on the Trevni columnar storage format created by Doug Cutting, the creator of Hadoop. The first version, Apache Parquet 1.0, was released in July 2013. Since April 27, 2015, Apache Parquet has been a top-level Apache Software Foundation (ASF)-sponsored project.[5][6]
